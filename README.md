# The Concept
This code is meant to embody to ruleset of the popular card game Love Letter. While one could theoretically use it to replace the need for a physical copy, that is not the intent. There may come a time where you can interact with it as a human playing against a machine, that's not the primary goal. The primary goal is to allow a written set of rules to play against a written set of rules.

The long term goals are to have the system perform its own reporting so that two systems can play each other thousands of times and I can analyze their relative performance. I'd also like to eventually try out machine learning as one or more of the sets of play logic.

# The System
We're still kind of figuring this out so, be patient.

# The Owner
This is as mucha disclaimer as anything. I'm not a professional Python coder. I've used scripts to automate tasks but this is the most ambitious program I've ever written. Similarly, I've never seriously used Git or Github so I'm learning as I go. I will make mistakes and stupid decisions at times
